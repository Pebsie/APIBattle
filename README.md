# APIBattle
A web service RTS that is comprised entirely of an API built in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2019.

## What's the point?
This is based on a game that I made in 2015 called phpBattle. It used MySQL and PHP to recreate classic games like Travian or Evony but with a persistent grid based environment. It suffered massively, however, from all sql statements being hardcoded into PHP and all outputs being in HTML. It felt clunky and difficult to play as a direct result and there was no way of creating a nicer desktop client with a smoother UI.

This is the answer to that problem. This is a recreation of the base game with some balance improvements. What it lacks, however, is a client to display anything. It's just the API. The idea is that anyone can create their own client utilising this API and make it as polished as they want. I'll be creating my own example in another repo, too, with an "official" hosted server.
